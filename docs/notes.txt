    A node can be anything. A web service, a device, a program, anything. All it needs to do is implement 3 things:

    1: A get_meta action, which publishes a list of actions on it's channel, which ava can save.
    2: A listener that listens for actions and executes them.
    3: A publisher that publishes events and actions for ava to act on.
