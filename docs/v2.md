ntfy.sh will send message content only
so natural language messages for messages to the appropriate target
json actions to the appropriate target

This works fine because if there is no structured json in the content, that node will try to get that info to the real world however it is able to - voice, notification, display, chat, etc.

And if there is a json and it passes the schema, and it matches it's internal list of actions, it will run it.

Let's make this node first.





Node file:
    name
    description
    topic
    actions
